Assignment 7 annotations

Diapause in these Pearlfish are a set of 3 stages in the fish egg where development is suspended during prolonged dry periods within the environment. Basically these fish have evolved to time their development with the dry season where the puddles they live in evaporates. When the rain comes again, they develop normally and hatch out of their eggs, becoming free swimming larvae. These are the 2 stages we have genetic information on, with RNA and ATAC sequencing, exon locations, and annotation information.

In the image that I have provided, there are 2 main areas of focus: the 1st set of peaks at ~35,619 in both RNA seq and ATAC seq in larva and diapause samples, and a 2nd set of peaks just in the ATAC sequences of diapause and larva samples. The 1st peaks associated with badb gene seems to just be a relatively unregulated open bit of chromatine to transcribe the gene normally. The 2nd peak, at ~35,633 kb, could be associated with regulatory element due to its high ATAC peak indicating loose chromatin but lack of a peak in the RNA sequence. There are obviously exons located at ~35,630 kb, but very little RNA production, indicating some sort of regulatory player. The zgc:101765 and LOC119409388 genes are also reading in opposite directions at this high ATAC peak as well, further indicating regulatory agents (?).
